# Arithmetic Operators

# It is used to perform arithmatic operations

# Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, Devision

# +, -, *, /, % (modulas), // (Floor devision)

#a = 10
#b = 3

'''
print(a+b) # 13
print(a-b) # 7
print(a*b) # 30
print(a/b) # 3.33
print(a%b) # Reminder
print(a//b) # Floor devision
'''

#print(2**3) # to do the power

# 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

# Even: 2,4,6,8,10
# Odd: 1,3,5,7,9

# 199/2 -> Odd

num = 13

# odd or even

# If i am deviding any number with 2 and reminder
# is 1 then it's a odd number else it's a even number
